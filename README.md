Every day in our daily routine people encounter difficulties or problems from the biggest to the smallest. The pace of life we have is quite intense, and often we don't have enough time to fulfill all our needs or tasks. Many people, due to their commitments during the day, often find it impossible to make various purchases by going to stores in person. We have heard a lot about online shopping and deliveries from clothing stores, restaurants, fast food, perfumery, etc. But what is missing, or more precisely is in a fairly limited number, enough to be counted on the fingers of one's hand, are the applications for the purchase and distribution of groceries.
People who choose to use this application not only help themselves but also their relatives, such as grandparents, who, due to their age, cannot go out and do shopping while carrying heavy weights.

In addition to good time management, another good thing that comes from opening this application is eating healthily. As mentioned above, people, due to the momentum of everyday life, order through online applications to eat during meals mainly foods harmful to health, or as they are otherwise called "junky foods". Therefore, one of the main goals of creating this application is to give people the opportunity to improve their diet and have a healthier physique. Moreover, this application provides convenience and comfort for people with or without a busy life.  

Our application is pretty simple to use. After the user creates an account he can surf through the various grocery stores. After choosing the store they prefer we will show a variety of vegetables and fruits it has to offer. They can choose their desired products while adding them to cart and proceed to checkout when they are done. At the checkout they are asked to write down their address and a preferred time when would they like to have their groceries received. Regarding the payment it will be done with cash in hand or through a credit card.



As an app developer company we’re contacted on a daily basis by people with great ideas, looking for help to develop applications for them but in order to give you a ballpark, what we really need is a brief: a plan of work that gives us a feel for the size of the undertaking, and our role within it. Deciding app specifications is very important for us as a developer because firstly it allow us to get a real feel for clients needs, help us ascertain the size and price of the job and give us focus for the project. For this client we have to create a grocery shopping app. 


Development model for their application (Amber)
 
The hyper-local marketplace, as its name implies, is a form of competition that caters to the needs of a small area. A short walk from your house would surely lead you to a similar store, albeit one that is big and limited but is self-sufficient and meets almost all of the needs of the neighborhood's residents.
The most recent e-commerce buzzword is a hyperlocal framework. Due to grocery delivery, online grocery buying, home shopping, personal care services, etc., the success of hyper-local e-commerce websites has assumed a completely new dimension.
Local offline retailers and service providers now have new leases on life thanks to the rise and growth of hyperlocal networks. Despite the novelty of the concept, the internet's widespread use means that the globe is no longer novel. It has the power to raise offline merchants' businesses to entirely new standards.
The unique selling proposition of hyper-local e-commerce companies is their readiness to offer goods and services incredibly quickly. The hyperlocal distribution models promise their customers that they will gather up the products you ordered in as little as an hour. In this network we start with the customer which places an order on the app. The app sends the order to the local shop that is already registered and has an account in the application. After the order is ready delivery picks it up and takes it to the customer. This goes on in an endless loop as it is a definition of a network as well.


User requirements and Application specifications (Eria, Armena, Emla)

We are four developers that are going to work for this project and with his collaboration we have decided some app specification which are:
•	Background
So in order to give the best to our client we have taken some information about the business that is going to use our creation. The businesses that will use the application are local grocery stores which have a physical location but as an innovation in their business the owners will offer the possibility of online shopping and for this they have decided to pay for the creation of an application that will make it possible.

•	Unique selling point
We know that there are many others grocery app abroad but in Albania we will be the first to create such an application and we want to offer our client the best one. We want to create something unique and different and what will make the difference. 

•	Audience
As the application that we are going to create is a grocery shopping delivery app it means that is going to be used by people of different ages, from teenagers to elderly people so our aim is to create an app that is fully functional but on the other hand it’s not complicated and easy to be used.

•	Aims
The aim of creating this app is to increase the sales and profits of the client business but also help people on tight schedules and eat healthier. This is because the grocery shopping delivery app will save time to the people, customers which may live far from the locations of grocery shops will be able to purchase their groceries. 

•Platforms
When we decided which platform is best for this application we have consider the audience and chose to work with a cross-platform language. Cross-platform programming implies making a computer program that will be executed and run on different stages. This application can run on Android and iOS, for example.


Regarding the users there will be two types of users for this application. They both have to create a profile as a buyer or a seller. For the client to register he will need to complete his full name, phone number, age, email address and location in the registration form. For the seller in order to register his business he will need to complete the registration form with his full name, shop name, age, email, phone number and location. Each of them will be presented with an app with many features as listed below.

Customer App Features
1.	Profile Creation and Editing
This will be the first step users take when they open your app, to create a profile. Users will need to monitor their orders, make payments, and more, so it is crucial. The user will therefore need to establish a profile in order to customize everything. The user will be able to input the necessary information into the app and customize the profile as needed thanks to a registration and profile creation feature. Users will be able to edit their information and adjust preferences and options using the edit profile option.
2.	Signup and login
The establishment of user profiles and registration go hand in hand. For the sake of clarity, we have listed these as distinct features. They can sign up using a login and password. The majority of users will forget their passwords at some time in the future, so we included the forget password option in our app.
3.	Search Groceries
One of the most noticeable and important aspects of a grocery delivery app is this one.
Once logged in, a user can search for groceries or even neighboring grocery stores after logging into the app. A simple search option will be useful for finding the items the user needs to purchase online. You have a list of all the grocery products and stores, arranged by name, location, grocery type, and product preferences (fruits, vegetables, packaged foods, etc.). This is how it works. The user will find it much simpler to search for the items they want to purchase thanks to this smart list. They can browse the lists, choose a nearby grocery store, and make their order.
4.	Checking Local Grocery Stores
Once the user has located a nearby grocery store, the user will want to review the vendor's profile to confirm that they are placing their order from the appropriate location. This informs clients about other people's opinions of the grocery shop, such as whether orders are delivered on time, whether the given goods are accurate and contain all the proper products, or whether payment refunds, if any, are started and completed on time. This function will assist you in ensuring excellent customer service because stores with high ratings will receive more orders than those with low ratings.
5.	Add To Cart Option
This is among the most crucial aspects that any app for shopping or purchasing groceries needs to have. You cannot anticipate them to place an order from a single location, finish the order process, pay the retailer, then proceed to the next location to place an order, and so on. To allow users to choose all of their things from whatever location they like, put them to a cart, and then place their order all at once, a cart option is offered. Moreover, shoppers occasionally add products to a basket but finish the order the next day or at another time. A cart makes sure that the chosen items are saved in one place and that the order can be finished whenever the client is prepared to do so.
6.	Payment Gateway
The users' order has been placed, and now it's time to finish the transaction by checking out. An significant component is online payment. You can link your grocery app with many payment alternatives, such as payment through credit cards or even a cash delivery option to make it simple for the customer to pay online.
7.	Reviews and Rating Option
The app's success kind of depends on whether it has this feature that allows customers to rate and review products. We undoubtedly want to aid users in selecting the best options available. On the one hand, it will act as a motivator for the registered stores to offer top-notch services in order to rise to the top of the list by receiving favorable reviews. On the other hand, it will assist customers in learning which store offers the greatest services, thus boosting their confidence in using our platform to order groceries.

Vendors Panel Features
1.	Registration & Profile Management
Similar to the client-side app, the admin panel also needs registration and profile management features. The many vendors can register with your company and use this panel to manage their data. They have the ability to add new products, update their existing ones, alter prices, and more.
2.	Dashboard
They can quickly manage their store with the dashboard. With the use of this feature, the admin can see all the crucial dashboard features, including the orders, payments, and deliveries.
3.	Content Management
With the aid of this function, you may improve the user experience by updating and managing the content. The choices to control the material often include:
•	Edit information about the grocery store, such as the name, address, phone number, and hours of operation.
•	Add images
•	Product list editing (example – deleting items, changing the price)
You are assisting users in having a better UX from your grocery platform by keeping the information current and in real-time.
4.	Handling The Orders
The order management tool aids retailers in managing order receipt and delivery. The grocery retailers can use this capability to manage order status and inform clients when their orders will arrive at their doorstep. Here, you can also conduct other features like handling payments and viewing order history.
5.	Status Update
The vendors can use this function to update the order's delivery status after picking it up. The choices for status updates are:
•	in progress
•	delivered
•	delayed and more
