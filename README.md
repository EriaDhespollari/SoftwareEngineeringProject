INTRODUCTION

Every day in our daily routine people encounter difficulties or problems from the biggest to the smallest. The pace of life we have is quite intense, and often we don't have enough time to fulfill all our needs or tasks. Many people, due to their commitments during the day, often find it impossible to make various purchases by going to stores in person. We have heard a lot about online shopping and deliveries from clothing stores, restaurants, fast food, perfumery, etc. But what is missing, or more precisely is in a fairly limited number, enough to be counted on the fingers of one's hand, are the applications for the purchase and distribution of groceries.
People who choose to use this application not only help themselves but also their relatives, such as grandparents, who, due to their age, cannot go out and do shopping while carrying heavy weights.

In addition to good time management, another good thing that comes from opening this application is eating healthily. As mentioned above, people, due to the momentum of everyday life, order through online applications to eat during meals mainly foods harmful to health, or as they are otherwise called "junky foods". Therefore, one of the main goals of creating this application is to give people the opportunity to improve their diet and have a healthier physique. Moreover, this application provides convenience and comfort for people with or without a busy life.  



Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

A grocery shopping app is a flexible tool that has something to offer many different kinds of users across various contexts. It is our considered opinion that utilizing a grocery shopping app can be quite advantageous for a wide range of people. This includes not only individuals, but also families
and businesses; any group or organization that must buy groceries on a regular basis can benefit from such an app.
 Individuals: Nowadays, people are constantly balancing busy schedules. A grocery shopping application is perfect for those who struggle to find the time. They can browse and order items from the comfort of their homes, and have them delivered to their doorstep at the desired time.
 Families: Families nowadays can take advantage of the technology that provides a grocery shopping app, which represents a practical solution because it allows them to manage their purchases more simply and with ease. Through using this application, families get the benefit of creating shopping lists, tracking their orders and reordering their favorites items.
 Seniors: Seniors who, due to their age, cannot go out and do shopping while carrying heavy weights can choose to use this application in order to get their grocery shopping done. Without having to leave their homes, they can order groceries and have them delivered.
 Businesses: In the food service industry, restaurants, cafes and other businesses can optimize their efficiency by making use of modern technology. Specifically, they can turn to grocery shopping apps to order crucial items for their operations with ease and have these items delivered directly to them. Some people who choose to use this application can not only help themselves but also their relatives, such as grandparents, by ordering items for them and having them delivered to their home address.



Product Scope

The product scope of this application is to provide a comfortable and easy shopping experience to users, where they can effortlessly browse through different products, create shopping lists and get
everything delivered, all from the comfort of their own home. It typically includes:
 User Interface: A top priority when it comes to the app&#39;s interface is user-friendliness. This means that the design and organization should be natural; making it easy for users to navigate through different features and functions.
 Product Catalog: Users of the app should be able to select from a wide range of locations depending on their home address or perhaps a desired store in another neighborhood. They should also be able to select products from different categories like fruits and vegetables depending on what the stores offers, all in the comprehensive product catalog.
 Shopping list: Users should be able to make and save shopping lists through the app, which they can then simply modify and reuse for future purchases.
 Payment Gateway: The application needs to feature a safe payment gateway that enables users to pay with different methods like credit cards or cash in hand.
 Customer Support: To respond to user questions and issues, the app should offer dependable customer care channels like chat assistance, email help, or phone support.


Our application is pretty simple to use. After the user creates an account he can surf through the various grocery stores. After choosing the store they prefer we will show a variety of vegetables and fruits it has to offer. They can choose their desired products while adding them to cart and proceed to checkout when they are done. At the checkout they are asked to write down their address and a preferred time when would they like to have their groceries received. Regarding the payment it will be done with cash in hand or through a credit card.

As an app developer company we’re contacted on a daily basis by people with great ideas, looking for help to develop applications for them but in order to give you a ballpark, what we really need is a brief: a plan of work that gives us a feel for the size of the undertaking, and our role within it. Deciding app specifications is very important for us as a developer because firstly it allow us to get a real feel for clients needs, help us ascertain the size and price of the job and give us focus for the project. For this client we have to create a grocery shopping app. 



Product Perspective

The app's overall perspective, place in the market, and compatibility with user requirements are all referred to as the &quot;product perspective&quot; of a grocery shopping app. This application is totally new and a needed novelty to the market. Firstly, it is essential to understand the user&#39;s needs and behavior. Secondly, developing a sustainable business model that complies with the required regulations is crucial for long-term success. Below are some important aspects of this product:
 User Needs: The app offers meets the needs of the user by offering a different range of stores and products, simple navigation, secure payment and reliable delivery.
 Market Analysis: A grocery app comes in need to people from different age groups and backgrounds. It adapts to the users need by offering him a wide range of products. Considering it is still an innovative idea we feel that it will be very successful in the market as people have become more and more accepters of new technology that conveniences their life.
 Technology: The app is user-friendly and comprehensive by all ages. It has been developed by using languages like php, html, javascript and css for its design. The app is available to download on both androids and ios.
 Software Process Model: We intend on using the waterfall model to develop this application. This is a plan-driven model that includes these phases:
a. Requirements analysis and definition
b. System and software design
c. Implementation and unit testing
d. Integration and system testing
e. Operation and maintenance
Despite choosing this model we decided to incorporate elements from other software process models as well to ensure the best quality product.
 Regulatory Compliance: The application will obviously comply with the relevant laws and regulations, such as data protection and payment processing. Some of these regulations are:
a. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) - Businesses that accept credit card payments are required to adhere to the PCI DSS security standards. These requirements must be met by the grocery shopping app in order to protect the privacy of financial transactions.
b. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - The European Union's (EU) GDPR is a rule that controls how people&#39;s personal data is processed. The grocery shopping app must adhere to GDPR regulations if it collects, stores, or otherwise processes the personal data of EU people.
c. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - The FDA&#39;s rules for food safety, labeling, and packaging must be followed by the grocery shopping app if it offers food products.
d. Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) - The FTC Act is a law that forbids unfair and dishonest business activities. The grocery shopping app needs to make sure that its customer-facing business procedures are just and open.

 Business Model: According to our research a hyper-local marketplace is the best business model for this application. The hyper-local marketplace, as its name implies, is a form of competition that caters to the needs of a small area. A short walk from your house would
surely lead you to a similar store, albeit one that is big and limited but is self-sufficient and meets almost all of the needs of the neighborhood's residents. Due to grocery delivery, online grocery buying, home shopping, personal care services, etc., the success of hyper- local e-commerce websites has assumed a completely new dimension. The unique selling proposition of hyper-local e-commerce companies is their readiness to offer goods and services incredibly quickly. The hyperlocal distribution models promise their customers that they will gather up the products you ordered in as little as an hour. In this network we start with the customer which places an order on the app. The app sends the order to the local shop that is already registered and has an account in the application. After the order is ready delivery picks it up and takes it to the customer. This goes on in an endless loop as it is a definition of a network as well. We plan to make some changes to this model in order to fit our user requirements and needs.

User requirements and Application specifications (Eria, Armena, Emla)

We are four developers that are going to work for this project and with his collaboration we have decided some app specification which are:
•	Background
So in order to give the best to our client we have taken some information about the business that is going to use our creation. The businesses that will use the application are local grocery stores which have a physical location but as an innovation in their business the owners will offer the possibility of online shopping and for this they have decided to pay for the creation of an application that will make it possible.

•	Unique selling point
We know that there are many others grocery app abroad but in Albania we will be the first to create such an application and we want to offer our client the best one. We want to create something unique and different and what will make the difference. 

•	Audience
As the application that we are going to create is a grocery shopping delivery app it means that is going to be used by people of different ages, from teenagers to elderly people so our aim is to create an app that is fully functional but on the other hand it’s not complicated and easy to be used.

•	Aims
The aim of creating this app is to increase the sales and profits of the client business but also help people on tight schedules and eat healthier. This is because the grocery shopping delivery app will save time to the people, customers which may live far from the locations of grocery shops will be able to purchase their groceries. 

•Platforms
When we decided which platform is best for this application we have consider the audience and chose to work with a cross-platform language. Cross-platform programming implies making a computer program that will be executed and run on different stages. This application can run on Android and iOS, for example.


Regarding the users there will be two types of users for this application. They both have to create a profile as a buyer or a seller. For the client to register he will need to complete his full name, phone number, age, email address and location in the registration form. For the seller in order to register his business he will need to complete the registration form with his full name, shop name, age, email, phone number and location. Each of them will be presented with an app with many features as listed below.

Customer App Features
1.	Profile Creation and Editing
This will be the first step users take when they open your app, to create a profile. Users will need to monitor their orders, make payments, and more, so it is crucial. The user will therefore need to establish a profile in order to customize everything. The user will be able to input the necessary information into the app and customize the profile as needed thanks to a registration and profile creation feature. Users will be able to edit their information and adjust preferences and options using the edit profile option.
2.	Signup and login
The establishment of user profiles and registration go hand in hand. For the sake of clarity, we have listed these as distinct features. They can sign up using a login and password. The majority of users will forget their passwords at some time in the future, so we included the forget password option in our app.
3.	Search Groceries
One of the most noticeable and important aspects of a grocery delivery app is this one.
Once logged in, a user can search for groceries or even neighboring grocery stores after logging into the app. A simple search option will be useful for finding the items the user needs to purchase online. You have a list of all the grocery products and stores, arranged by name, location, grocery type, and product preferences (fruits, vegetables, packaged foods, etc.). This is how it works. The user will find it much simpler to search for the items they want to purchase thanks to this smart list. They can browse the lists, choose a nearby grocery store, and make their order.
4.	Checking Local Grocery Stores
Once the user has located a nearby grocery store, the user will want to review the vendor's profile to confirm that they are placing their order from the appropriate location. This informs clients about other people's opinions of the grocery shop, such as whether orders are delivered on time, whether the given goods are accurate and contain all the proper products, or whether payment refunds, if any, are started and completed on time. This function will assist you in ensuring excellent customer service because stores with high ratings will receive more orders than those with low ratings.
5.	Add To Cart Option
This is among the most crucial aspects that any app for shopping or purchasing groceries needs to have. You cannot anticipate them to place an order from a single location, finish the order process, pay the retailer, then proceed to the next location to place an order, and so on. To allow users to choose all of their things from whatever location they like, put them to a cart, and then place their order all at once, a cart option is offered. Moreover, shoppers occasionally add products to a basket but finish the order the next day or at another time. A cart makes sure that the chosen items are saved in one place and that the order can be finished whenever the client is prepared to do so.
6.	Payment Gateway
The users' order has been placed, and now it's time to finish the transaction by checking out. An significant component is online payment. You can link your grocery app with many payment alternatives, such as payment through credit cards or even a cash delivery option to make it simple for the customer to pay online.
7.	Reviews and Rating Option
The app's success kind of depends on whether it has this feature that allows customers to rate and review products. We undoubtedly want to aid users in selecting the best options available. On the one hand, it will act as a motivator for the registered stores to offer top-notch services in order to rise to the top of the list by receiving favorable reviews. On the other hand, it will assist customers in learning which store offers the greatest services, thus boosting their confidence in using our platform to order groceries.

Vendors Panel Features
1.	Registration & Profile Management
Similar to the client-side app, the admin panel also needs registration and profile management features. The many vendors can register with your company and use this panel to manage their data. They have the ability to add new products, update their existing ones, alter prices, and more.
2.	Dashboard
They can quickly manage their store with the dashboard. With the use of this feature, the admin can see all the crucial dashboard features, including the orders, payments, and deliveries.
3.	Content Management
With the aid of this function, you may improve the user experience by updating and managing the content. The choices to control the material often include:
•	Edit information about the grocery store, such as the name, address, phone number, and hours of operation.
•	Add images
•	Product list editing (example – deleting items, changing the price)
You are assisting users in having a better UX from your grocery platform by keeping the information current and in real-time.
4.	Handling The Orders
The order management tool aids retailers in managing order receipt and delivery. The grocery retailers can use this capability to manage order status and inform clients when their orders will arrive at their doorstep. Here, you can also conduct other features like handling payments and viewing order history.
5.	Status Update
The vendors can use this function to update the order's delivery status after picking it up. The choices for status updates are:
•	in progress
•	delivered
•	delayed and more



Operating Environment
When developing a grocery shopping app, it is important to consider the environment in which the software will operate. Specifically, this means taking into account key considerations such as hardware platform and operating system versions.
1. Hardware Platform
When considering the hardware platform on which your app will run, it is important to ensure that it can operate smoothly on a variety of devices; this includes smartphones and tablets with varying specs like processor speed, RAM capacity and storage size of memory.
2. Operating system
To ensure widespread availability and accessibility of the grocery shopping app, it is essential that it be developed to run on popular operating systems such as Android and iOS. In fact, the app should be designed to accommodate both newer and older versions of these operating systems in order to cater to users who are using older devices.
3. Other software components or applications
Compatibility with different software components or applications, such as web browsers or social media apps, is also crucial for seamless functioning. As a result, developers must take extra care in ensuring that the grocery app runs smoothly with these components and applications

There are additional factors that the grocery shopping app developers need to consider, apart from hardware and software requirements. The app should also factor in network and security specifications to ensure user protection. It is essential for this app to function across diverse network connections, which include not only Wi-Fi but also cellular data. Furthermore, the developers should prioritize incorporating security features into the design as a measure against potential risks that may compromise users&#39; sensitive information.

The user documentation for the grocery shopping app will comprise several components.
1. User Manual
A user manual is a comprehensive guide explaining how to use the application. The manual will provide in-depth instructions on all of the app&#39;s features and functions, including but not limited to creating an account, searching for products, adding items to cart, making payments and tracking orders.
2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
The FAQs section of the app will offer answers to frequently asked questions about account management, product search, order tracking, and payments. This resource will provide users with quick solutions to common problems they may encounter while using the app. The user documentation for the app will be made available in a digital format, and users can access it either through the app or its website. It is designed to be user-friendly, with clear language and illustrations that make it easy to navigate the various features and functions of the app.



Assumptions and Dependencies

Assuming the implementation of a grocery shopping app, there are several potential factors that could impact the requirements stated in its Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
1. Availability of third-party APIs for location tracking, payment gateways and other such functionalities is an important consideration to keep in mind.
2. The smooth functioning of the app would also depend heavily on internet connectivity and network availability.
3. User acceptance is another key factor to consider given their willingness to adopt new technologies for online grocery shopping.
4. Vendors' consistency and precision in sharing data pertaining to accessibility of products and the pricing are essential factors.
5. The scalability of the app is important so that it can endure heavy traffic from numerous users at peak hours without crashing.
6. Ensuring security against cyber-attacks, fraudulent activities, and safeguarding user data must be taken into account as well.
7. Compatibility with various operating systems on diverse hardware such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones stands paramount.
8. It is also necessary to abide by legal and regulatory requirements for online grocery shopping which encompass tax policies, privacy guidelines, and laws that protect user information.

These too models show how the customer and the vendor act when processing an order. 
We start with the customer. The customer firstly logs in. After logging in, the customer searches for products and puts the preferred ones in the cart. After being sure of his list he proceeds to check out and pay for the products as well as specify the address he would like the products to be delivered.
While the vendor’s action are a bit different. When the vendor logs in he has to check the order list as he might have received many different orders. After preparing each order and sending them off he updates the status notifying the customer that the order is in its way. When everything is completed and the vendor calls it a day he can log out.
